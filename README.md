Amnesia: The Dark Descent
=======================
Hello! This is my personal fork of Amnesia: The Dark Descent and its HPL 2 engine.

At the moment I'm still setting things up!! A current goal is to upgrade libraries used by the game engine, since many of them are outdated.

The CMake files for macOS and Linux are currently outdated and won't work. Visual Studio 2019 on Windows should work just fine!

If you use this fork of the code, be sure to change the working directory to *your* install of Amnesia, because mine is at a weird path that yours probably won't be at!
