Amnesia: The Dark Descent
=======================
Hello! This is my personal fork of Amnesia: The Dark Descent and its HPL 2 engine.

At the moment I'm still trying to get things set up. A major goal right now is to try and remove outdated libraries such as SDL 1.x, and to try and remove or upgrade dependencies that rely on outdated tools so that it can be compiled on more modern versions of Visual Studio. Also, ideally, updating the CMake files so that they work with Windows and Visual Studio can just be ditched entirely.

If you use this fork of the code with Visual Studio, make sure to change the working directory to *your* install of Amnesia, because mine is at a weird path that yours probably won't be at.
